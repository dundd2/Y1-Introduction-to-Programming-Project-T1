This is a java project created for the G5066: Introduction to Programming in Nov 2023. For more information please check that 2 docx. 
This GitHub repository contains a Java program simulating a college environment with a library, students, and textbooks. The simulation is split into two parts: an initial project and a follow-up assignment, both focused on object-oriented programming principles.

Part 1: Library Management System
The first part of the project involves the implementation of three Java classes: TextBook, Library, and LibraryCard. These classes model a simple library system where students can borrow textbooks. The README for Part 1 provides details about each class, their fields, constructors, and methods. Additionally, it outlines the testing process and grading criteria.

Part 2: College Simulation
The second part extends the project by introducing two new classes: Student and College. In this simulation, students join a college library, borrow textbooks, and study. The College class orchestrates the interactions between students and the library. The README for Part 2 details the new classes, their functionalities, and the required documentation. It also explains how to run the program as a standalone application.

Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, ensure you have a Java development environment set up. The main method in the College class serves as the entry point. You can run the program with specific parameters such as the number of students, textbooks, and simulation steps.

java College <numStudents> <numTextBooks> <numSteps>
Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs or educational purposes.

Documentation
The code is documented using JavaDoc conventions, providing insights into classes, methods, and parameters. The generated API documentation is included in the repository.

Unit Testing
JUnit test classes (TestStudent and TestCollege) are provided to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionalities. These tests cover various scenarios and are an essential part of validating the program.
